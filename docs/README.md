# Berkeley Class Site

{: .important-title }
> Don't Publish These Docs
>
> This folder (`docs/`) is _published_ in the berkeley-class-site repo for readability, and to add as further test cases. It is recommended that you remove `docs/` from you local course websites, or set `published: false` on these files.

The documentation here is a brief overview for course staff. Most customization should be done by reviewing the [Just the Docs][jtd] documentation.

This website is built using [Jekyll][jekyll] and deployed to [GitHub Pages][gh_pages]. When you push to GitHub, the website is automatically compiled and updated.

## Tasks for each semester:

- Make a new respository.
  - Start by clicking "Use Template" on berkeley-class-site"
  - It is easiest to name it the semester shortcut, like `fa24`, i.e. the `baseurl` of your website.
- Search the repo for `TODO(setup)`
- Copy files from previous semester.
- More to come.
