### LECTURE ORDERING ###
# each entry requires either a 'slug' or a 'title' field
# you may have both if you'd like to override the title from the lecture file
# optionally you may also include a 'nonumber' boolean field to suppress numbering
# and a 'link' field to override the default link to the lecture page or provide an external link
