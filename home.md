# UC Berkeley Class Site Template

A template for static UC Berkeley class websites (with a focus on EECS/CS/DS courses) built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Just the Docs](jtd), and [Just the Class](https://kevinl.info/just-the-class/).

{: .important }
Ready to get started? See our [documentation]({% link docs/README.md %}).

## Features

- **Fast development**: Focus on writing course content in Markdown that is automatically compiled into HTML/CSS. Run a single terminal command to build and preview the website. Any changes you make trigger autoregeneration of relevant website files and you just need to refresh to see them.
- **Accessible by default**: We have [continuous integration]({% link docs/continuous-integration.md %}) workflows that ensure that the entire website is accessible to users with disabilities (whether in light or dark mode)
- **Reasonable defaults and boilerplate**: Using this template comes with all the commonly used pages needed in a course website, such as home page, [syllabus]({% link syllabus.md %}), [course schedule](% link schedule.md %), assignment pages, [staff page]({% link staff.md %}), [resources]({% link resources.md %}), and calendar (both [static]({% link calendar.md %}) and [dynamic]({% link calendar_dynamic.md %}) if your course uses Google Calendar).
- **UI components and styling out of the box**: This template comes with all the UI components, styling, and colors from [Just the Docs][jtd] as well as [UC Berkeley branding](https://brand.berkeley.edu/).
- **Instant, full text search**
- **Light and dark mode**
