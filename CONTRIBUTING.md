You can propose changes to the course website by:

   See GitHub’s guide on forking:  
   https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

2. **Making edits** in your fork  
   Examples of useful contributions include:
   - Fixing typos and broken features.
   - Implementing new features that will be useful for **all courses.** Course specific features are best implemented in your course's repository. If you're unsure, please open an [issue](https://github.com/berkeley-cdss/berkeley-class-site/issues) to start a discussion.

   Please include:
   - A clear description of what you changed  
   - The motivation for the change  
   - Any relevant context or screenshots

   Ensure that your pull request also includes documentation for your changes. Documentation lives in the `docs` directory.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Aim for **singular, focused updates.** If your contribution spans multiple features, consider submitting separate PRs. For complex overhauls that can’t be easily split, please keep maintainers in the loop to ensure a smooth merge.
- Follow the existing **style and structure** of the site.
- Use **inclusive language**, both in your documentation and code. 
- Test all changes locally and ensure that the automated accessibility checks and linting pass.
