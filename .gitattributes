# Enforce devs to always use LF, even on Windows
# Note: git will store text files in LF
* text=auto eol=lf

# Force batch scripts to always use CRLF line endings so that if a repo is accessed
# in Windows via a file share from Linux, the scripts will work.
*.{cmd,[cC][mM][dD]} text eol=crlf
*.{bat,[bB][aA][tT]} text eol=crlf
*.{ics,[iI][cC][sS]} text eol=crlf

# Force bash scripts to always use LF line endings so that if a repo is accessed
# in Unix via a file share from Windows, the scripts will work.
*.sh text eol=lf
